<div class="about-ben-text">
  I started playing the bass when I was 18 years old. I wanted to play drums in the high school jazz band, but there were too many drummers and zero bassists. I took home the school electric bass for the summer and I have not looked back since. I have professionaly worked in Washington D.C., San Francisco, San Diego, and many other places in between. You can currently catch me at local venues in sunny San Diego most often.
